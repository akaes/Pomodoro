#EXPLANATION - Update: Twitter-API has changed and the Script needs an update

###TEST ENVIRONMENT:
Mac OS X, Python 2.7.6

##TASK:
Tool for [Pomodoro-Technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) - a website opens if the breaks are starting.

##REQUIREMENTS:
* a functional twitter-account

##PROCEDURE:
* registration to use the twitter-API
* generation of the needed keys for OAuth and registration
* definition of the values used for notification and alerting
* modification of the python-script

##FILES
* pomodoro_akut.py 

##Docs APIs and libraries:
* [twitter-API](https://dev.twitter.com)
* [python-library Twitter](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twitter/1.15.0)
